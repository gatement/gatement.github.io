<strong>Event Manager</strong><br/>
<hr/>
Event Manager can be created by calling "gen_event:start_link/0(1)". Event Manager has its own Process. Send events to the created Event Manager by "gen_event:notify/2".<br/>
Application "Kernel" has a default Event Manager, named "<strong>error_logger</strong>". It is recommended to use this Event Manager to report errors, warnnings, information and custom events.<br/>
Application "SASL" has a Event Manager, named "<strong>alarm_handler</strong>". It also contain a simple alarm handler in it with the same name.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Event Handler</strong><br/>
<hr/>
One Event Manager can have/add/install one or more Event Handlers, which is an implementation of OTP behaviour "<strong>gen_event</strong>". Event Handler run in the Event Manager Process.<br/>
Application "Kernel" has a default Event Handler added/installed to Event Manager "error_logger", which can be configurable by "Kernel" Application Configuration parameter "error_handler".<br/>
Application "SASL" has an Event Handler added/installed to Event Manager "error_logger" as well, which will output OTP behaviours logs to tty by default. It can be configurable by "SASL" Application Configuration parameter "sasl_error_logger".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<strong>custom Event Handler</strong><br/>
<hr/>
Implement OTP behaviour "gen_event" and add/install it to an Event Manager ("error_logger" or a self created Event Manager).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<strong>custom Event type for Event Manager "error_logger"</strong><br/>
<hr/>
Use <br/>
error_logger:info_report/2, <br/>
error_logger:warning_report/2 <br/>
