# Queue for SYN_RECV connections.
# Even after exchanging SYN, SYN ACK, ACK messages, the socket still under SYN_RECV state if the ESTABLISHED connection backlog is full.
# Once after the connection enroll this queue, it will resend SYN ACK message for tcp_synack_retries times with exponential backoff(1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s), and timeout after that in 63s.
# If this syn backlog queue is full, new SYN request will be silently ignored (clients will re-send the SYN requests).
